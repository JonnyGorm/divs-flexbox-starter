                I was born in Scotland, now live in Sydney, Australia. I came here for a bit of travel and to see other parts of the world, then stayed permanently, which seems to be a common theme with people coming to Aus.

                My passion: I also love music, not been to any gigs for a while (DAMN COVID) but I fill that void by playing the guitar at home, poorly... I am also a big fan of mixed martial arts and between work and study I go to my local martial arts gym to train most days of the week.

                A fun fact: I had an MMA fight a couple of years ago. I lost but it was a close contest and I only broke 1 toe and a metatarsal in my foot and tore 2 ligaments in my finger, you should have seen the other guy (not). It was a competative bout and we have remained friends since.
